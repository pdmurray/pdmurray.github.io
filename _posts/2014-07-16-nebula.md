A Collaborative Web Based Analytics & Visualization Tool Box

[details][details]
<!-- truncate_here -->

Nebula is a collaborative web based analytics & visualization tool box.

At HGST, engineers generate tons of data throughout the development and testing of new Hard Disk Drive products.  Nebula is a platform designed to simplify searching for, and visualizing all of that data.  In the past at HGST, engineers needed to manually download binary files and view them one at a time with a cumbersome process.  Now, all of that data is collected and automatically imported into a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and is fully searchable (backed by elasticsearch).  Through a middleware layer (Node.js/express), the data is easily graphed and compared across populations on a beautiful responsive javascript single-page app (Marionette.js and Highcharts.js).
